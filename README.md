## Online Store project for phone wrap skins
I used dbrand images (only for demonstration purposes, pls don't sue me)

A small eCommerce project written in JS and PHP. Working authentication, adding and retrieving products, cart management, and finalizing purchases using Stripe payment platform

StripeJS API keys were not uploaded.

This project was made to challenge myself to make something big and unusual to me, it is by no means perfect as I keep learning. Some repetitive code present :)
